IP
An IP address is a unique address that identifies a device on the internet or a local network. IP stands for "Internet Protocol",
which is the set of rules governing the format of data sent via the internet or local network.

In essence, IP addresses are the identifier that allows information to be sent between devices on a network.
They contain location information and make devices accessible for communication.
The internet needs a way to differentiate between different computers, routers,
and websites. IP addresses provide a way of doing so and form an essential part of how the internet works.

IPv4
The original Internet Protocol is IPv4 which uses a 32-bit numeric dot-decimal notation that only allows for around 4 billion IP addresses.
Initially, it was more than enough but as internet adoption grew, we needed something better.

Example: 102.22.192.181

IPv6
IPv6 is a new protocol that was introduced in 1998.
 Deployment commenced in the mid-2000s and since the internet users have grown exponentially, it is still ongoing.

This new protocol uses 128-bit alphanumeric hexadecimal notation.
This means that IPv6 can provide about ~340e+36 IP addresses. That's more than enough to meet the growing demand for years to come.

Example: 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334
